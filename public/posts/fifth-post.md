### What is React Native?

React Native is a popular framework created by Facebook that allows developers to build mobile applications for Android and iOS using JavaScript and React. It provides a way to create native apps with one codebase, saving time and effort while delivering a smooth, native-like experience.

### Why Choose React Native?

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Build once, run on both Android and iOS.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: React Native has a large community and a wide range of third-party libraries.
- **Hot Reloading**: See changes in real-time as you code.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the need for separate teams for Android and iOS.

### Getting Started

To start using React Native, you need to install Node.js and a code editor like Visual Studio Code. Then, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the React Native CLI

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

### 2. Create a New Project

```bash
npx react-native init MyNewApp
```

### 3. Run Your App

Navigate to your project folder and run the app on an emulator or connected device.

```bash
cd MyNewApp
npm start
```

### Key Takeaways

React Native makes mobile app development more accessible by enabling you to use web technologies to build native apps. Whether you’re an experienced developer or just starting, it’s worth exploring.
